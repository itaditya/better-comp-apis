## ðŸŒ— Let user override.

If our component is built like this

```jsx
function Card(props) {
  const { children } = props;

  return (
    <div
      role="Card"
      classname="card"
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

then people who use this component can't add anything themselves to the `card` div.

* no event handlers
* no aria attributes
* no data attributes
* no autofocus, required, tabindex, contenteditable....
