## What to do instead?

Think what to allow the the person override and what not to override.

```jsx
function Card(props) {
  const { className, children, ...otherProps } = props;

  const classNames = `card ${className}`;

  return (
    <div
      role="Card"
      {...otherProps}
      classname={classNames}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then we can do this

```jsx
<Card
  role="Demo Card"
  className="demo-card"
>
  Hope you're having fun!
</Card>
```

and the result would be

```html
<div
  role="Demo Card"
  className="card demo-card"
>
  Hope you're having fun!
</div>
```
