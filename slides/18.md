## So try this

1. Make app-specific components.

*Instead of*

```jsx
<Card/>

<AutoComplete/>

<Carousel/>
```

```jsx
<ProductCard/>
<ProfileCard/>

<CountrySearch>
<BankSearch>

<MenuCarousel>
```

2. Extract out the common bits when you see a clear pattern.

This helps us because with then we **don't have to**

* think how to build highly reusable stuff.
* ensure it works for all the edge cases.
* write big documentation.
